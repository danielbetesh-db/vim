##Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:
1. **Installation**
To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the root of the project and run:
```
npm install
```

2. **Compilation and Execution**
After installing the dependencies, you can compile the TypeScript files and execute the resultant JavaScript. To do so, run:
```
npm start
```

This command will invoke npx tsc to compile the TypeScript files and then node ./build/index.js to run the main file.
